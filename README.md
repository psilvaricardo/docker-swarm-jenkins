## Installing Docker in Arch Linux

To install Docker on Arch Linux and ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to run it, you can follow these steps:

- Install Docker using the following command: 
```shell
sudo pacman -S docker
```
- Add your user to the docker group using the following command:
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
- Start the Docker service using the following command:
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
- Verify that Docker is running correctly by running the following command:
```shell
docker run hello-world
```
- Enable the Docker service to start automatically at boot time using the following command:
```shell
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
By following these steps, you should be able to install and configure Docker on Arch Linux and ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to run it without issues.

- Install docker buildx: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx/

## Useful Docker Commands

- Stop the Docker daemon and remove any running Docker containers:
```shell
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -aq)
```

- Start a new container from an image
```shell
docker run = docker create + docker start // this should be identical
docker create <image name for this container> // creating a container has to do with creating the file system snapshot
docker start <container id to start> // this is when we actually execute whatever process that is supposed to be executed inside the container, it will not output anything to the console
docker start -a <container id to start> // same as the previous one, the -a parameter will make docker to watch for any output from the container and print it out to your terminal
docker run <image name> <command> // this command overrides the default command
docker run <image name> <command> // this command overrides the default command

docker run -p <port number of incoming request on localhost>:<port number listening inside the container> <imageId> // Container Port Mapping

* Docker Volumes
docker run -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id>
```

- List running containers
```shell
docker ps // list all the running containers
docker ps --all // list all the containers regardless of its status
```

- List locally available images
```shell
docker images
```

- Download an image from a registry
```shell
docker pull
```

- Upload an image to a registry
```shell
docker push
```

- Build a new image from a Dockerfile
```shell
docker build // this will look for the default 'Dockerfile' file
docker build -f <filename> // this way you can specify a file name different than the default 'Dockerfile' file
```

- Run a command in a running container
```shell
docker exec
docker exec -it <container id> <command> // execute an additional command in a container attaching to the STDIN
```

- Stop a running container
```shell
docker stop <container id> // a hardware signal SIGTERM is send to the primary process inside that container with a 10 seconds grace period
docker kill <container id> // a hardware signal SIGKILL is send to the primary process inside that container
```

- Remove a stopped container
```shell
docker rm
docker system prune -a --volumes // it will remove all stopped containers, all dangling images and all dangling build cache.
```

- Remove a locally available image
```shell
docker rmi
```

- Manage Docker networks
```shell
docker network
```

- Manage Docker volumes
```shell
docker volume
```

- Manage multi-container applications with Docker Compose
```shell
docker-compose
```

- Retrieving / Get logs from a Container
```shell
docker logs <container id> 
```

- Adding TAGs to the docker images
```shell
docker build -t <your-DockerHub-Id>/<ImageName>:<version> <directory of files or folders used for the build>
```


## Useful Docker Compose Commands

Overall, Docker Compose is a powerful tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. That can simplify the deployment and management of multi-container Docker applications, particularly in complex environments with multiple dependencies.

Here are some of the main use cases for Docker Compose:

- Multi-container applications: Docker Compose is particularly useful for running multi-container applications, where each container performs a different function. For example, you might have a web application that uses a separate container for the web server, the database, and a Redis cache. Docker Compose allows you to define and manage all of these containers as a single application.

- Dev/Test environments: Docker Compose can be used to define and run multi-container applications in local dev/test environments. By defining the application in a single docker-compose.yml file, developers can quickly and easily spin up a local environment that matches the production environment.

- Orchestrating deployments: Docker Compose can also be used to manage the deployment of multi-container applications to production environments. By defining the application and its dependencies in a single file, it becomes easier to manage and deploy the application across multiple servers or cloud providers.

- To start all the services defined inside of your docker-compose.yml configuration file
```shell
docker compose up
docker compose up --build // to rebuild all the services/docker images
docker compose up - d // run in the background
```

- To stop all the services defined inside of your docker-compose.yml configuration file
```shell
docker compose down
```

- Check the status of docker images inside your docker compose file on the present directory:
```shell
docker compose ps
```

- We can configure automatic container restarts in case our application crash or something happens using restart policies. The Docker Compose restart policy controls what happens when a container exits, whether it is due to an error, a crash, or a deliberate stop. There are several restart policies available in Docker Compose, each with its own behavior:

** no: This is the default policy, and it means that the container will not be restarted if it exits. (This needs to go within single or double quotes: 'no').

** always: This policy will always restart the container, regardless of the exit status. This is useful for containers that need to run continuously, such as web servers or databases.

** on-failure: This policy will restart the container if it exits with a non-zero exit code. You can also specify how many times to attempt a restart using the --restart-max-attempts flag. The default is to try an unlimited number of times.

** unless-stopped: This policy will always restart the container, except when the container is explicitly stopped using the docker-compose stop command or the docker stop command.


## Docker Files

- What's a Docker file? 
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions that are used to build a Docker image. The Dockerfile specifies the components and configuration required for the image, including the base image, the software packages to be installed, and any customizations that need to be made. Using a Dockerfile, developers can define a repeatable and consistent process for building Docker images that can be easily shared and deployed across different environments. Docker images built from Dockerfiles are lightweight and portable, making them ideal for use in container-based deployments.
